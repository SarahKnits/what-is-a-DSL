# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

This programming language is for people who want to make pictures using code.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

Repeating images with shifts and decreasing size are very easy to do with 
simple recursion and scaling. Any kind of repetitive pattern is reasonably
easy to do, with only having to code out the pattern once and then define 
the shifting.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

Writing was surprisingly hard to do. Although I based my characters on the
initial “WELCOME” screen, it was harder than I expected. 

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

I read through some of the tutorials and looked at the “WELCOME” code. I then
tested what changing different parameters did to the picture. I repeated this
until I had a good general idea, and then came up with a picture that I liked
and executed it.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

As mentioned above, the characters were difficult to write, and I think they
turned out well.
